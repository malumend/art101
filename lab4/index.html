	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>This lab has required us to create pseudocode for an everyday task and a
			computer task. We did so and then implemented it in our javascript.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p> We had some issues in understanding the difference between where our
		everyday pseudocode and our task pseudocode is supposed to be.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Well hopefuly you are able to see our index.htm file that we have created,
		and everyhthing is swell.</p>

		<p>The lists above are our pseudocode examples. One is a everyday task
			about sandwich making. The other is our lab 4 example for a coinflipping
			simulation.</p>
