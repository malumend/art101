	<h1>Subject of Lab3</h1>
	<p>This lab has required hands on application of what we learned in class  to
		make our very own webpage. We both made a homepage and then worked on the
		layout of our Lab3 page together.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I personally struggled with the little errors such as forgetting to close
		the paragraphs. The major problem came with linking a photo because we
		couldn't figure out what to label the png.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> Well hopefully you are able to see our index.html file that we have
			created,
			and everything is swell.</p>
