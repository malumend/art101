      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The main challenge we had was with the new task of attaching an event,
        without screenshots or clarification to guide us.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>While in class, we were able to follow exactly, but we had quite a few
        errors on our own.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Everything should look good and that is good.</p>
